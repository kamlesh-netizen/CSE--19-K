  <h1>This is a Bordered Heading</h1>
    <p>
        This paragraph has a border around it. CSS properties like <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, and <code>border-color</code> are used to define the appearance. 
        Padding is also applied to create space between the text content and the border.
